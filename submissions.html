            <p>STATUS: OPEN for photo essays; OPEN for written content.</p>

            <p>ASTRO publishes written content, photo essays and video. We are interested in pieces that capture the
                sense
                of finding oneself in a new place and all the feelings that accompany that. In your submissions we hope
                to
                find something familiar, something to connect to, a shared experience, a strong sense of place,
                character
                and time.</p>

            <p>Our submissions come from all types of creatives and others; journalists, anthropologists, photographers,
                poets, painters etc. But most of all we are interested in stories that can bring together anyone who has
                left their home and has created a new one somewhere else and can help us build a community.</p>

            <p>We are a small team and 100% of our content comes from submissions. We see ourselves as a nurturing,
                welcoming digital gallery space in which anyone, with or without a portfolio, can share their
                experiences,
                engage and entertain readers. We want to make you part of a community of modern migrants, a community
                with
                which we all share something in common, but also to make your content look amazing and show it to the
                world!
            </p>

            <p>Written submissions and Photo essays for ASTRO are accepted at any time from September to June. We will
                read
                your work and respond to you within 1 month.</p>

            <p>Submit <a href="mailto:contact@thisisastro.com" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
